# Unstructured-change-detection-using-CNN
This repository contains implementation of the paper 'Mohammed El Amin, Arabi &amp; Liu, Qingjie &amp; Wang, Yunhong. (2016). Convolutional neural network features based change detection in satellite images. 100110W. 10.1117/12.2243798'.  


# Instrustion to run the file
The feat.py file accepts the two file paths corresponding to the two input patches as arguments.
